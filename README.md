** Trying to make X11 Forwarding work in phusion/baseimage.

In the **phusion/** folder, you will find my attempt at making X11 Forwarding work in phusion/baseimage

In the **ubuntu/** folder there is a successful attempt, based on the ubuntu:14.04 image

In each folder the README tells you how to test X11 Forwarding (with 3 shell commands)


Ultimately, my goal is to have something like [docker-desktop](https://github.com/rogaha/docker-desktop) on phusion/baseimage.
